# fxOption
An FX Asian option or Asian currency option is a special type of option contract where the payoff depends on the average of the underlying exchange rates over a certain period of time. The payoff is different from the case of a European option or American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the underlying FX rate at exercise date.
